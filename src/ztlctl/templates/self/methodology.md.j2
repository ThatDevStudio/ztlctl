# Methodology — {{ vault_name }}

Operational guide for working within this zettelkasten vault.
{% if topics %}
Focus areas: {{ topics | join(", ") }}.
{% endif %}

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic notes** — one idea per note, linked to related concepts
2. **Progressive formalization** — seeds capture, saplings develop, evergreens solidify
3. **Bidirectional linking** — connections go both ways; isolated notes lose value
4. **Tag taxonomy** — `domain/scope` pattern keeps tags navigable at scale
5. **Evidence-based promotion** — status upgrades require demonstrated quality

## Content Type Reference

| Type | ID Pattern | Purpose | Status Flow |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Note | `ZTL-NNNN` | Core knowledge atoms | seed → sapling → evergreen |
| Decision | `ZTL-NNNN` | Architectural/design decisions | seed → sapling → evergreen |
| Knowledge | `ZTL-NNNN` | Synthesized understanding | seed → sapling → evergreen |
| Reference | `ref_NNNN` | External sources and citations | seed → sapling → evergreen |
| Task | `TASK-NNNN` | Actionable work items | open → active → done/cancelled |
| Log | `LOG-NNNN` | Session records | open → closed |

## Workflow Guidance

### Creating Notes

1. **Search first** — check for existing notes on the topic
2. **Choose the right type** — note for ideas, reference for sources, decision for choices
3. **Tag immediately** — apply `domain/scope` tags at creation time
4. **Link aggressively** — add wikilinks to related notes in the body
5. **Set honest status** — new insights start as seeds unless they arrive fully formed

### Developing Notes

- Review seed notes regularly — promote or archive stale seeds
- Add key points and supporting evidence to move seed → sapling
- Ensure bidirectional links and referenced claims for sapling → evergreen
- Use decision notes to record and revisit architectural choices

### Session Workflow

- Start sessions with `agent session start "topic"` to track work context
- Close sessions to trigger enrichment: reweave, orphan sweep, integrity check
- Session logs capture what was accomplished for future reference

### Graph Maintenance

- Run `check` periodically to detect structural issues
- Use `reweave` to discover and create missing connections
- Review `graph gaps` to find structurally important but underconnected notes
- Use `graph themes` to discover emergent topic clusters

{% elif tone == "assistant" %}
## Workflow Summary

- Search before creating to avoid duplicates
- Use proper content types and tag conventions
- Start sessions to track work context
- Close sessions to trigger automatic enrichment
- Run `check` periodically for vault health

{% elif tone == "minimal" %}
## Workflow

- Search → Create → Tag → Link
- Use sessions for work tracking
- Run `check` for vault health
{% endif %}

{% if client == "obsidian" %}
## Obsidian Integration

- Vault is configured for Obsidian compatibility
- Wikilinks (`[[note]]`) work natively in Obsidian
- Tags render in Obsidian's tag pane
- The `.obsidian/` directory contains client-specific configuration
